winds, leads a very old Christmas song; he grows blithe and loud as others join the chorus)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIGHTHOUSE REEF<|>geo<|>A dismal reef of sunken rocks some league or so from shore, chafed and dashed by waters all year; seaweed clings to its base and storm-birds rise and fall above it)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIGHTHOUSE<|>geo<|>A solitary lighthouse built on the sunken reef, with thick stone walls and a loophole that casts a bright ray over the awful sea; tended by two keepers who warm themselves by a fire)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIGHTHOUSE KEEPERS<|>organization<|>Two men stationed at the lighthouse who watch the light, share grog, wish each other Merry Christmas, and sing; one elder keeper bears a face weather-scarred like a ship’s figurehead)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ELDER

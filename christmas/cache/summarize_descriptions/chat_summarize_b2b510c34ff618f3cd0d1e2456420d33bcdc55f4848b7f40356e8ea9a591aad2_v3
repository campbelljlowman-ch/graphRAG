The GHOST OF CHRISTMAS YET TO COME reveals Scrooge’s bleak fate through future scenes, culminating in the chilling moment when the Spirit points to Scrooge’s own neglected grave. Confronted with the consequences of his life of coldness and isolation, EBENEZER SCROOGE breaks down and pleads with the silent apparition to alter the course of his destiny. He promises to reform, vowing to honor Christmas in his heart, live with compassion, and transform his conduct so the dark “shadows of what may be” do not become what will be. The encounter marks Scrooge’s decisive turning point, prompted by the wordless guidance of the GHOST OF CHRISTMAS YET TO COME.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 394, "prompt_tokens": 196, "total_tokens": 590, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 192, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}

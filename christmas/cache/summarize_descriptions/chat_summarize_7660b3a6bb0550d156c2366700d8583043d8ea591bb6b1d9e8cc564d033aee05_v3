Bound in chains and wearing a head wrapper, the apparition appears visibly to Scrooge in his chambers, profoundly unsettling him. It delivers a grave warning about the consequences of a life lived without compassion and declares that Scrooge will be visited by three spirits, setting a specific schedule and noting that the first will arrive when the bell tolls one. After conveying this timetable and admonition, MARLEY'S GHOST opens the window to reveal other wandering spirits, then joins their mournful dirge and departs into the bleak night. In this encounter, MARLEY'S GHOST serves as both harbinger and moral guide, initiating the sequence of hauntings meant to awaken Scrooge to self-reflection and possible redemption.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 818, "prompt_tokens": 239, "total_tokens": 1057, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 640, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}

By the time of the story’s events, Jacob Marley is deceased; his ghost appears to Ebenezer Scrooge, speaks with him, and warns him about the consequences of an uncharitable, worldly life and the fate that awaits those who live without compassion. Scrooge addresses Marley as a good friend during this visitation, and Marley’s communication is both a personal admonition and a dire example of the chains forged by greed. Marley is closely associated with arranging or foretelling the forthcoming hauntings, directing Scrooge to expect the Spirits whose visits may redeem him.

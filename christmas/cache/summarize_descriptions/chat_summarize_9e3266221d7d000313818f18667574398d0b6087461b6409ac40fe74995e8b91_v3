It serves as the setting for the moral consequences described by the Ghost, a stage where actions and their ethical weights are revealed and measured. In this depiction, Earth is not only a physical realm but also a moral landscape infused with spiritual presence and accountability. It is the very world invoked by the Spirit when condemning those who practice bigotry and selfishness in the name of the Spirits, highlighting the misuse of spiritual authority and the ethical failings that occur among the living. Thus, EARTH functions simultaneously as a habitation of the immortal and a theater of human conduct, where spiritual roaming and relentless labor intersect with moral judgment and denunciation.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 353, "prompt_tokens": 201, "total_tokens": 554, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 192, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}

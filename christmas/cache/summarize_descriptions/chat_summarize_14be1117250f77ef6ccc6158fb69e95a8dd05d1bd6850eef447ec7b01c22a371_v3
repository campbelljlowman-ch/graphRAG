It is toasted by Fred, Scrooge’s cheerful nephew, who offers “a happy New Year,” and it is likewise invoked by Mrs. Cratchit in her family toast as the upcoming holiday, wishing a “happy New Year.” The nephew explicitly wishes Scrooge “A Happy New Year,” extending familial warmth despite Scrooge’s earlier coldness. After his transformation, Ebenezer Scrooge embraces this spirit and joyfully proclaims, “A happy New Year to all the world!” NEW YEAR thus functions as a narrative marker of hope and fresh beginnings, reinforcing the story’s movement from miserliness to generosity, isolation to community, and bitterness to rejoicing, as multiple characters—Fred, Mrs. Cratchit, and Scrooge himself—hail it as the emblem of renewed life and shared benevolence just after Christmas.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 530, "prompt_tokens": 225, "total_tokens": 755, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 320, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}

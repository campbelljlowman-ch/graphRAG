She is also described as having Mr. Scrooge as an old friend, reflecting the faded closeness and familiarity between them. In looking back on their connection, EBENEZER SCROOGE reflects on the family life he might have had through BELLE, contemplating the domestic warmth and companionship he forfeited when their paths diverged. Together, these details present BELLE as a symbol of Scrooge’s lost opportunity for love and family, and EBENEZER SCROOGE as a man who, in hindsight, recognizes what he relinquished by allowing other priorities to take precedence over their relationship.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 745, "prompt_tokens": 191, "total_tokens": 936, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 576, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}

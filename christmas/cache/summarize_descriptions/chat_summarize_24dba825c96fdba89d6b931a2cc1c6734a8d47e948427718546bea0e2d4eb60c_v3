Under United States copyright law, many works are in the public domain, and Project Gutenberg eBooks whose underlying texts are not protected by U.S. copyright can be freely copied, distributed, and reused within the United States with minimal restrictions. Users outside the United States are advised to check their local laws, as the public-domain status and permissible uses may differ by country. In the U.S., distribution and use of Project Gutenberg eBooks are also subject to the Project Gutenberg trademark license.\n\nThe United States serves as the principal legal reference point for determining eBook eligibility on Project Gutenberg, with U.S. copyright status providing the baseline for inclusion. Additionally, U.S. federal and state laws govern the Project Gutenberg Foundation’s tax-deductible contributions and charitable solicitation compliance across all 50 states. These state laws also influence the enforceability of warranty disclaimers and limitations of liability set out in the Project Gutenberg license terms. Consequently, the United States is identified as the primary jurisdiction for lawful use of the specific Project Gutenberg eBook referenced.\n\nSeparately, the United States appears in a literary context as a recognized sovereign issuer of securities: Scrooge muses that his bill of exchange would resemble a United States security if days could not be counted, highlighting the country’s association with formal instruments of public credit.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1197, "prompt_tokens": 381, "total_tokens": 1578, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 896, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}

A poor apprentice at a milliner’s, Martha Cratchit works long hours and often comes home late from work. During the holiday, she plans to rest at home, taking a brief respite from her demanding schedule. On one such return, she arrives late, hides to surprise her father, and is warmly embraced by her parents when she reveals herself. Martha Cratchit also recounts seeing a countess and a lord, sharing these glimpses of high society from her work at the milliner’s. Her experiences highlight both the Cratchit family’s modest circumstances and their warmth and affection, with Martha’s diligence, humor, and love for her family underscored by her tender interactions with her parents and her eagerness to be home for the holiday.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 831, "prompt_tokens": 227, "total_tokens": 1058, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 640, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}

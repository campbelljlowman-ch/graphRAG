Present during a lively celebration at Belle’s home, he became the center of affectionate commotion when he was caught trying to put a doll’s frying pan into his mouth and was, for a moment, mistakenly suspected of having swallowed a toy turkey—a worry that proved unfounded and added to the merriment of the scene. In everyday moments, THE BABY accompanies his mother on errands, notably joining the lean wife on a trip to buy beef. Together, these glimpses portray THE BABY as a cheerful emblem of domestic life: a source of humor, tenderness, and shared community in the tailor’s family and Belle’s household alike.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 999, "prompt_tokens": 197, "total_tokens": 1196, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 832, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}

An old acquaintance of Belle and uncle to Fan’s child, he lives narrowly for business, earning the Cratchit family’s epithet “Ogre,” even as Bob Cratchit ironically hails him as “Founder of the Feast.”\n\nWarned at home that he will be haunted by Three Spirits, Ebenezer Scrooge hears the church chimes, gazes upon phantoms outside his window, and, fearful and exhausted, goes to bed. He wakes in darkness, anxiously checks the time, and remains awake for the foretold visitation at one o’clock. With the Ghost of Christmas Past he revisits a decaying school, weeps at his neglected younger self, joyfully recalls storybook companions from the books that once kept him company, and sees his sister Fan arrive to bring him home for Christmas. He is shown his apprenticeship with Fezziwig—helping put up the shutters and joining a Christmas Eve party—and recalls Belle. Rebuked by the Spirit, he regrets not giving to the boy who sang a carol at his door the previous night; struggling against the lesson, he presses the extinguisher-cap onto the Spirit’s head.\n\nSubmitting to the Ghost of Christmas Present, Ebenezer Scrooge touches the Spirit’s robe and surveys the bustling city on Christmas morning. In the Cratchit home he asks anxiously whether Tiny Tim will live, even as the family discusses him as their feared “Ogre” and calls him “Founder of the Feast.”\n\nGuided by the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, Ebenezer Scrooge seeks the identity of a dead man, looks into his office to find it no longer his, and in a churchyard reads his own name on a grave. Kneeling, fearful, and pleading for mercy, he resolves to change and apply the moral lessons to his life.\n\nAwakening transformed, Ebenezer Scrooge laughs and cries with joy, recognizes signs of the Spirits in his room, calls out to confirm it is Christmas Day, and vows to honor Christmas and live by the lessons of Past, Present, and Future. He raises Bob Cratchit’s salary, provides warmth and help to the family, becomes a second father to Tiny Tim, and, living by a “Total-Abstinence Principle,” is praised thereafter for knowing how to keep Christmas well.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1496, "prompt_tokens": 855, "total_tokens": 2351, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 960, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}

At first he reacts strongly—and bitterly—to Christmas greetings, and the memory of being left alone at Christmas in his youth lingers over him. He regrets small cruelties, such as failing to reward a carol-singer, recognizing how his disdain for CHRISTMAS has hardened his heart.\n\nSeeking to learn, Scrooge undertakes a supernatural tour centered explicitly on CHRISTMAS. The visions he witnesses revolve around his Christmastime experiences: past scenes of isolation, present celebrations he has scorned, and future outcomes shaped by his neglect. These visitations and the reflections they provoke all occur during the Christmas season, providing the lens through which his values are tested and transformed.\n\nEmerging from this journey, EBENEZER SCROOGE offers “a merrier Christmas,” resolves to celebrate with Bob Cratchit over a “Christmas bowl,” and acts on the generosity he once resisted. His reformed spirit becomes evident in his renewed relationships and his public goodwill, and he is said to know how to keep CHRISTMAS well—honoring the holiday’s spirit of compassion, remembrance, and community throughout the season and beyond.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1095, "prompt_tokens": 259, "total_tokens": 1354, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 832, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}

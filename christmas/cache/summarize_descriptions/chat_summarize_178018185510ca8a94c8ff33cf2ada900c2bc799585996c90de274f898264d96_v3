In the context of the story’s Christmas Eve festivities, Cornhill is depicted as the place where Bob Cratchit, in a moment of cheerful celebration, slides down a makeshift slide at the end of a lane of boys. CORNHILL is also specifically referenced in an illustration that portrays this scene, showing Bob Cratchit’s joyful slide on Christmas Eve.

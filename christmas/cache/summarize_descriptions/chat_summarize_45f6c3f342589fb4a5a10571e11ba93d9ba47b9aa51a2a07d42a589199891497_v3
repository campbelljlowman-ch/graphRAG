He sits by a charcoal stove amid piles of refuse iron, rags, bottles, bones, and other oddments, inviting visitors into his cramped parlour to have their bundles valued and bought. Practical and unsentimental, he examines and appraises items—sometimes stolen, including goods taken from a deceased man’s home—marks their worth by chalking prices on the wall, and pays the sellers their proceeds on the spot. Operating from the shadows of his cluttered premises, he methodically sorts through wares, names a price with practiced ease, and concludes the bargain in cash. OLD JOE embodies the hard-nosed trade of second-hand dealing, combining shrewd valuation with a ready market for whatever comes through his door.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 506, "prompt_tokens": 238, "total_tokens": 744, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 320, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}

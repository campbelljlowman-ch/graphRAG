Despite his death, Marley’s name remains on the firm’s sign, underscoring his enduring association with Scrooge and their business. The title of the relevant stave—highlighting the episode of “Marley’s Ghost”—signals his central role in the supernatural framework of the story. Marley’s presence is first suggested when his face appears supernaturally in Scrooge’s door knocker, a striking omen that unsettles Scrooge. The chambers where Scrooge now lives once belonged to Marley, further intertwining Marley with the physical setting and Scrooge’s daily life. Scrooge, though outwardly dismissive, half expects to encounter traces of Marley and repeatedly recalls his face, indicating Marley’s persistent psychological hold over him. References to the room’s hearth—“in Scrooge’s time, or Marley’s”—situate Marley within the same era and space, reinforcing his prior connection to the setting even in scenes where he does not appear. Overall, Marley is portrayed as a definitive, seven-years-dead figure whose legacy, memory, and ghostly foreshadowing profoundly shape Scrooge’s environment and expectations.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 592, "prompt_tokens": 301, "total_tokens": 893, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 320, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}

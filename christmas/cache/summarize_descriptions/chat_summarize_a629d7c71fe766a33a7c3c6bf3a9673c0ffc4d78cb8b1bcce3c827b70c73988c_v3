As the final guide in Scrooge’s nocturnal journey, it leads him through a series of stark “shadows” of the future, scenes that appear as what will happen but are, in truth, what may happen if he does not change his ways. The Spirit’s revelations grow progressively darker, culminating at a neglected grave that it indicates relentlessly—Scrooge’s own. Confronted with this fate, Scrooge pleads with the Phantom to show that the future is not fixed and that his destiny can be altered. In the moment of his resolve to reform, the Ghost’s terrifying presence recedes, collapsing into a bedpost, signaling Scrooge’s return to his chamber and the end of the visitation that spurs his transformation.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 805, "prompt_tokens": 313, "total_tokens": 1118, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 576, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}

They gather around their hearth for a modest yet festive Christmas meal, with each child helping to prepare and celebrate the dinner. Their holiday feast features a roasted goose served with apple sauce and mashed potatoes, followed by a proudly presented flaming pudding. Afterward, they enjoy hot drinks along with apples, oranges, and chestnuts, savoring the simple abundance and the warmth of being together.\n\nIn another moment of their story, the family is shown united in mourning Tiny Tim. Though grieving his loss, they honor his memory by recalling his patience and gentleness, and they resolve to preserve harmony, kindness, and mutual support within their home. Taken together, these scenes reveal the CRATCHIT FAMILYâ€™s resilience and deep affection: they cherish humble joys, face hardship with dignity, and remain steadfastly devoted to one another.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 720, "prompt_tokens": 228, "total_tokens": 948, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 512, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}

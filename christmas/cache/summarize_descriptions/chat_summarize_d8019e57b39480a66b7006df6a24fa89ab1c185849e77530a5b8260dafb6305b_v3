Marley is Scrooge’s deceased business partner—dead seven years at the time described—and upon Marley’s death Scrooge became his sole executor, administrator, assign, residuary legatee, friend, and mourner. Despite Marley’s death, his presence persists powerfully in Scrooge’s thoughts and surroundings. Scrooge repeatedly recalls Marley, fixating on details such as Marley's pigtail, and imagines seeing Marley's face everywhere. Most strikingly, Scrooge perceives Marley's face in the door knocker of his own home, and Marley's image seems to surface again around the hearth, linking Marley to Scrooge and the same hearth in scenes that underscore their enduring association. These recurring apparitions and recollections reveal that Marley was not only Scrooge’s business partner but effectively his only intimate connection, a relationship that continues to haunt Scrooge after death—both through Scrooge’s legal and personal obligations and through the unsettling, ever-present echoes of Marley’s visage in Scrooge’s domestic and mental space.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1020, "prompt_tokens": 259, "total_tokens": 1279, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 768, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}

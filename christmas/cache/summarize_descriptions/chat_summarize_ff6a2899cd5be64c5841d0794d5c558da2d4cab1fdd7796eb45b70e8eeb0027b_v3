Emitting a clear, bright light, the Spirit carries an extinguisher-like cap, which Scrooge momentarily uses to cover its radiance. Identifying itself as the Ghost of Christmas Past, it declares its purpose as Scrooge’s welfare and reclamation. The Spirit clasps Scrooge’s arm, touches his heart to uphold him, and leads him through a wall to witness “shadows of the things that have been,” orchestrating the transitions between scenes and offering commentary.\n\nShining with an unwavering light that prompts reflection, the Ghost of Christmas Past shows Scrooge visions of his earlier Christmases, including his lonely boarding-school days and the moment when a child—his sister Fan—came to fetch him home. It comments on Fan’s life and child, connecting those memories to Scrooge’s present. The music at festive gatherings recalls to Scrooge the joys the Spirit had revealed, notably the warmth and generosity of Fezziwig, whose influence the Spirit encourages Scrooge to reconsider in light of his own changing values. As a phantom showing things past, the Ghost of Christmas Past guides Scrooge through these memories to awaken empathy, regret, and self-knowledge, anchoring its lessons in luminous clarity even as its form remains elusive.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 758, "prompt_tokens": 384, "total_tokens": 1142, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 448, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}

He tenderly cares for his frail son: seating TINY TIM beside him, holding his withered hand with love, carrying him home from church, and delighting in the boy’s singing at family gatherings. TINY TIM, Bob’s beloved son, is the constant focus of his father’s attention and concern. Bob fears that TINY TIM might be taken from him, a dread sharpened by the child’s fragile health. In a later, grievous turn, BOB CRATCHIT mourns TINY TIM deeply: he remembers carrying him, visits TINY TIM’s resting place, and kisses his face in farewell. Throughout, the relationship between father and son is defined by tenderness, devotion, and the dignity of their shared moments—every gesture from BOB CRATCHIT underscoring the love he bears for TINY TIM.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 833, "prompt_tokens": 243, "total_tokens": 1076, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 640, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}

The Spirit illuminates these memories with a radiant light that symbolizes truth and remembrance, guiding Scrooge to witness formative moments and commenting on what they reveal about his character and choices. Confronted with regret and sorrow, Scrooge initially resists the Spirit’s revelations; in his discomfort he attempts to cover the GHOST OF CHRISTMAS PAST’s light with an extinguisher-cap, trying to shut out the painful clarity of the past. Nevertheless, the journey compels reflection, and EBENEZER SCROOGE ultimately acknowledges the moral lessons presented to him. He resolves to live by what he has learned, marking a decisive step in his transformation from a hardened miser to a penitent man determined to change his conduct and honor the spirit of Christmas.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 521, "prompt_tokens": 224, "total_tokens": 745, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 320, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}

In life, Jacob Marley was Ebenezer Scrooge’s business partner, a relationship underscored by Scrooge’s own reflections on Marley’s burial, which confirm Marley’s death and Scrooge’s direct association with him at that time. After his death, Jacob Marley returns as a ghost and appears directly to Scrooge, engaging him in a clear, purposeful conversation. During this encounter, Marley provides a crucial prediction about forthcoming ghostly visits, shaping and guiding Scrooge’s expectations as midnight approaches. Scrooge’s awareness of Marley’s death, combined with the immediacy of Marley’s spectral presence and his explicit warning, creates a continuum from their past partnership to their posthumous interaction. Marley’s visitation functions as both a confirmation of the reality of the supernatural and a directive that frames how Scrooge anticipates and interprets what is to come. Through this sequence—Scrooge’s acknowledgment of Marley’s burial, Marley’s ghostly appearance, and Marley’s warning about additional visitations—both SCROOGE and JACOB MARLEY are portrayed as figures whose former business bond transitions into a transformative, otherworldly engagement, with Marley’s message setting the stage for Scrooge’s experience at midnight.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 536, "prompt_tokens": 224, "total_tokens": 760, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 256, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}

Defined more by others’ reactions than by any revealed biography, THE DEAD MAN functions as a focal point for public gossip, private calculations, and muted social judgment. His lonely setting, the transactional tone of the conversations about him, and the mixed responses he provokes underscore a community’s pragmatic indifference and the moral ambiguity surrounding his legacy.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 498, "prompt_tokens": 202, "total_tokens": 700, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 320, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}

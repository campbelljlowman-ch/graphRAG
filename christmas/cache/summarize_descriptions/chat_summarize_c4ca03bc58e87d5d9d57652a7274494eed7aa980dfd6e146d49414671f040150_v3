Old Jacob Marley is bound by a long, rattling chain made of cash-boxes, keys, padlocks, ledgers, deeds, and heavy steel purses—a chain he forged in life “link by link” through a narrow devotion to business and the counting-house. He is described with a pigtail, waistcoat, tights, and boots, and he produces booming, clanking noises as he moves. Capable of passing through solid doors yet able to sit, he emits a frightful cry and, in one terrifying moment, unties a bandage from his head so that his lower jaw drops.\n\nMarley’s spirit is tormented, condemned to wander the world without rest, remorsefully witnessing human suffering he once ignored. He appears to warn Scrooge of a similarly grim fate if he does not change, prompting Scrooge’s reflections on life and kindness. Jacob Marley foretells—and is often understood to facilitate—the visits of three Spirits who will offer Scrooge a chance at redemption; Scrooge remembers Marley’s prediction just before each subsequent apparition. In recollections of the past, Marley is noted as having been near death, underscoring the reality of his demise and the urgency of his message. Through this harrowing visitation, JACOB MARLEY serves as the catalyst for Scrooge’s moral awakening.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1209, "prompt_tokens": 540, "total_tokens": 1749, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 832, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}

During the party games, especially blind man’s-buff, she becomes the spirited focus of attention for Topper, who repeatedly pursues her. She protests the unfairness of his single-minded chase and insists on proper play, yet he persists and eventually catches her; later, the two are seen in confidential conversation, suggesting a mutual, playful rapport. In the evening’s wordplay, when Fred poses a riddle in the “Yes and No” game about a disagreeable, growling creature, PLUMP SISTER is the one who exclaims that the answer is Scrooge. Altogether, PLUMP SISTER emerges as a lively, good-humored presence—witty, sociable, and central to the merriment and gentle romance that animate Fred’s party.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 708, "prompt_tokens": 230, "total_tokens": 938, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 512, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}

Hard, tight-fisted, and covetous, he keeps his counting-house frigid, grudging his clerk Bob Cratchit even a holiday, derides Christmas as “humbug,” refuses his nephew Fred’s dinner invitation, eats alone at a tavern, and lives in the gloomy rooms that were Marley’s. He signed Marley’s burial register and was Marley’s sole executor, administrator, assign, residuary legatee, sole friend, and sole mourner, answering to both names of the firm.\n\nOne bitter night he locks himself in, sits by a low fire taking gruel while nursing a cold, and encounters strange phenomena: a ringing bell, clanking chains, and Marley's apparition. Caustic and skeptical, he calls the vision humbug, jokes that indigestion might cause it, wonders if a ghost can sit, and even worries about spontaneous combustion. When confronted by the specter’s chain and dislocated jaw, he clings to his chair, falls to his knees, and pleads for mercy.\n\nLightly clad in slippers, dressing-gown, and nightcap, he is escorted by Spirits. With the Ghost of Christmas Past he revisits the country road and little market-town where he was bred, his lonely schooldays, his warm apprenticeship at Fezziwig’s, and the broken engagement in which Gain displaced love—memories that make him hang his head and wish to speak kindly to his clerk. With the Ghost of Christmas Present he crosses moors, lighthouse, and ship at sea, marveling that people everywhere share Christmas. He stands in a baker’s doorway, questions the Spirit’s torch and Sabbath bakehouse closures, and vows to charge misdeeds done in the Spirit’s name to the doers. He accompanies the Spirit through London, observing his nephew’s lively party, joining games unseen and becoming the answer to a Yes-and-No riddle, and at the Cratchits’ he appeals for Tiny Tim’s life.\n\nGuided by the silent Phantom of the Future, he passes through the City Exchange and a foul, infamous quarter, witnessing thieves selling a dead man’s effects in Old Joe’s shop. He sees a corpse in a dark, empty house, begs to witness tenderness connected with a death, and at Bob Cratchit’s he beholds the family’s grief for Tiny Tim. Horrified, he understands that the unhappy man’s fate could be his own and resolves to learn and change.\n\nAwakening on Christmas Day in high spirits, SCROOGE sends a boy to buy the prize turkey for the Cratchits, pays for the turkey and a cab, and rewards the boy. He generously pledges back-payments to the portly gentleman, goes to church, and dines merrily at Fred’s. Early at the office he feigns anger at Bob’s lateness, then raises his salary and offers assistance to the struggling family. Thereafter, Ebenezer Scrooge is remembered as comical in cheer and steadfast in keeping Christmas well.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1994, "prompt_tokens": 1449, "total_tokens": 3443, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 1344, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}

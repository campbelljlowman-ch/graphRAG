Most commonly she is identified as the charwoman, and in some tellings she is described as a laundress; in either case, she is a domestic worker closely connected to the household. Mrs. Dilber is the first of the three to arrive at Old Joe’s shop, staggering in with a heavy bundle and boldly insisting he give fair value for her haul. Unapologetic and matter-of-fact, she argues that taking items from the dead harms no one, framing her actions as practical rather than immoral.\n\nHer bundle includes a telling array of household and personal effects stripped from the deceased man’s rooms: sheets, towels, wearing apparel, silver teaspoons, sugar-tongs, and boots. She presents these items with a practiced brazenness, negotiating with Old Joe and setting the tone for the others who follow. As a character, Mrs. Dilber embodies the gritty, opportunistic survivalism of the urban poor, her sharp tongue and unblushing demeanor revealing both her familiarity with hardship and her readiness to seize advantage where she finds it.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 834, "prompt_tokens": 241, "total_tokens": 1075, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 576, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}

CRATCHIT, Bob Cratchit’s wife, is the warm, industrious matriarch of the Cratchit household. A devoted homemaker and caring mother, she lays the cloth, makes the gravy, welcomes and looks after Martha, and presides over a modest yet joyful Christmas dinner. Poorly dressed but dignified, she rises to her duties with energy, sewing alongside her daughters and managing the home with resourceful pride. She anxiously prepares and triumphantly brings in the flaming Christmas pudding adorned with holly, relieved and delighted when it turns out well, and is praised by Bob for her culinary success. Though she calls Scrooge odious and stingy, she ultimately agrees to drink his health for Bob’s sake and in honor of Christmas Day. In moments of hardship, including the family’s grief over Tiny Tim in the darker vision of their future, MRS. CRATCHIT comforts Bob, interacts warmly with the children, and helps the family resolve to remember Tiny Tim tenderly and avoid quarrels. She affirms the kindness of the gentleman Bob met and, even while trying to hide her own weakened eyes, keeps working steadily, embodying steadfast love, practicality, and festive spirit at the heart of the Cratchit family.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1098, "prompt_tokens": 397, "total_tokens": 1495, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 832, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}

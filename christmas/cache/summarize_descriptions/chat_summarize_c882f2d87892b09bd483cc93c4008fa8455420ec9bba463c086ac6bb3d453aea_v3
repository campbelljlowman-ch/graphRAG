He works in a cold, cramped “tank”—a small, dismal cell—copying letters beside a meager fire. Dressed in a white comforter, he tries to warm himself by a candle, and is threatened with dismissal if he asks for more coal. SCROOGE’S CLERK earns fifteen shillings a week and supports a wife and family, marking him as poor and perpetually constrained by his employer’s miserliness. He is responsible for letting visitors in and out, and he quietly applauds the generous sentiments of Scrooge’s cheerful nephew, a gesture that draws Scrooge’s ire and further threats of dismissal.

Scrooge is explicitly tied to both episodes via high-salience relationship records, while the boarding school and its authoritative schoolmaster anchor the setting; the departure features ceremonial hospitality (wine and cake) and transport logistics involving a chaise and postboy, with the servant acting as intermediary.

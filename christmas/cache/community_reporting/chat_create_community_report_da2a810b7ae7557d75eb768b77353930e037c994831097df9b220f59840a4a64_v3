Scrooge orchestrates a transformative sequence at his counting-house—engaging a local boy and the poulterer’s man to deliver a prize turkey to Camden Town, then surprising Bob Cratchit at work by feigning anger before raising his salary and pledging broader family support. Inside the Cratchit home, the family’s modest but warmly shared Christmas dinner, toasts, and domestic rituals reveal resilience amid poverty and grief, including a somber alternative future in which Tiny Tim dies and the family vows harmony in his memory. The wider social and religious fabric of Christmas Day—marked by pealing steeples and communal worship—frames these events, while signs of economic precariousness coexist with new prospects for Peter through the kindness of a gentleman and Scrooge’s renewed benevolence.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Scrooge’s planned workplace reveal: from feigned anger to salary raise and family aid\",\n      \"explanation\": \"On the morning after Christmas, Bob Cratchit arrives late; Scrooge deliberately observes the lateness as part of a staged surprise, then play-acts his old gruffness before abruptly announcing a salary increase and concrete aid for Bob’s family, with a follow-up meeting planned that afternoon.

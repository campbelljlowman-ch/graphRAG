Marley’s identity and credibility are established by his self-declaration and Scrooge’s recognition, contextualized by Marley’s confirmed death. Marley’s message emphasizes ethical responsibility toward mankind and the neglected poor, symbolized by the chain he forged in life and now bears in death; even a civic-legal lens is invoked via the Ward’s hypothetical nuisance standard.

The core interactions include the organized sale of stolen goods at Old Joe’s, the First Woman and the Man in Faded Black presenting items stripped from the deceased, and the Phantom’s orchestration of Scrooge’s exposure to these events, which shapes Scrooge’s acknowledgment of personal moral peril.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Death triggers a chain from desolation to plunder and profit\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Unhappy Man’s death sets off the plundering of his possessions and the resale of those items, demonstrating a direct causal chain from death to illicit profit. The data explicitly link the death to the plundering and the depiction of the corpse, showing a sequence that begins with mortality and proceeds to exploitation and visual confirmation of neglect [Data: Entities (500, 496, 495, 497); Relationships (1147, 1143, 1149)].\\n\\nThese scenes collectively illustrate that the deceased’s isolation in life facilitated a post-mortem violation of dignity and property, as the thieves encounter little social resistance and convert his belongings into cash. The episode is anchored by the marketplace dynamic at Old Joe’s, where the proceeds of the theft materialize [Data: Entities (496, 499); Relationships (1114, 1115)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Old Joe monetizes the theft and catalyzes communal laughter over gains\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Old Joe functions as the commercial hub for converting stolen items into money: he appraises goods, chalks prices on the wall, and pays out, directly benefiting from the man’s death. The records detail that Old Joe purchases and resells the goods, and that his counting of money from a flannel bag prompts the thieves’ laughter over their gains [Data: Entities (496, 499); Relationships (1114, 1115)].\\n\\nThis indicates a structured and recurring practice, not a spontaneous incident. The appraisal and payout process at Old Joe’s formalizes the theft into a predictable economic exchange, encouraging participants to treat the deceased’s property as inventory rather than as remnants of a life deserving respect [Data: Entities (496); Relationships (1114, 1115)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Specific thefts reveal desecration: burial garments and personal effects are taken\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The First Woman steals bed-curtains, blankets, and the burial shirt from the body and room of the Unhappy Man, indicating both physical and symbolic desecration.

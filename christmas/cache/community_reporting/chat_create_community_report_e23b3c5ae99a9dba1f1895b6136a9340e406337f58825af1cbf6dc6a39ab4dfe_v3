The Boy confirms that it is Christmas Day, is tasked with procuring the large prize turkey from the nearby poulterer, and is incentivized to act quickly. The Poulterer's shop holds the turkey and dispatches an employee—the Poultererer's Man—to obtain delivery instructions.

He is sent to the poulterer to buy the large prize turkey and fetch the poulterer’s man, with a promised payment that increases if he returns quickly. These details indicate both the temporal trigger (Christmas Day) and the urgency of the task, with a clear incentive structure to ensure speed [Data: Entities (548); Relationships (1313)].\\n\\nSpecifically, the description records that he is promised a shilling, or half-a-crown if he returns within five minutes, underscoring the emphasis on immediate action and rapid coordination with the shop and its staff [Data: Entities (548)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"The Poulterer’s shop holds the large prize turkey and can dispatch staff for delivery instructions.\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Poulterer’s shop is identified as the location where the large prize turkey is hanging and the point of sale for the purchase.

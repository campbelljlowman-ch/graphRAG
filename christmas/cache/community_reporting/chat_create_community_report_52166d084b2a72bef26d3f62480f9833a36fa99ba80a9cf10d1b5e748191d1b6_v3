Scrooge is the narrative hub, explicitly linking to the Genii and the Sultan through his recollection, while within the tale itself the Sultan’s Groom is married to the Princess. The Genii are portrayed as supernatural beings who, in the remembered story, turned the Sultan’s Groom upside down and, along with the broader imagined company, consoled Scrooge’s lonely childhood. The Sultan appears indirectly via the status of the Groom, emphasizing the hierarchical setting of the tale, while the Princess’s role is defined through her marriage to the Groom.

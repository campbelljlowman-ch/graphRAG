Stave Two contains the episode titled \\\"The First of the Three Spirits\\\" and features Scrooge waking in darkness and listening for the hour as the chimes of a neighboring church mark time. The bell striking one o'clock is the appointed hour for the first haunting and is reused as the reference time for the second spirit, who is scheduled to visit Scrooge on the following night at the same hour.

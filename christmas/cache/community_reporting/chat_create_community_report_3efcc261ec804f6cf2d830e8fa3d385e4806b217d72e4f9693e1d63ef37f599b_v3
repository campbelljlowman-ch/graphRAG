Key ties include Scrooge’s orchestrated post-Christmas office encounter with Bob that transforms their work relationship; a logistics chain that sends a prize turkey to the Cratchit home in Camden Town; and scenes depicting family hardship in a foreseen future where Tiny Tim dies. Geographic anchors (Camden Town, Cornhill, and the counting-house) and social links (a street meeting with Scrooge’s nephew) knit together work, home, and seasonal ritual.

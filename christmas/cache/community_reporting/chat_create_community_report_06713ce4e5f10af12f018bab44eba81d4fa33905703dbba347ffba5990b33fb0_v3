Following the death of a miserly figure referred to as the “Wicked Old Screw,” a trio—Mrs. Dilber (a domestic worker), a laundress, and an undertaker’s man—loot the deceased man’s effects and converge by chance at Old Joe’s shop to vend their bundles for cash. Old Joe provides rapid appraisal and payment, turning the shop into the endpoint of an opportunistic pipeline that moves household goods from a deceased man’s rooms into the informal second-hand market.

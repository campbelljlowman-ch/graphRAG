Key touchpoints include the Cratchit household, a debtor family relieved by a creditor’s death, the revelation of two wretched children under the Spirit’s robe, and blessings extended across almshouse, hospital, gaol, and foreign lands. The narrative frame links Scrooge’s worth to Heaven’s judgment and compresses the Christmas holidays into the Spirit’s brief, urgent mission.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"THE GHOST is the central guide, invisible to others, orchestrating Scrooge’s moral awakening.\",\n      \"explanation\": \"THE GHOST is described as Scrooge’s supernatural guide—conversing directly with him, rebuking him, quoting his own hard-hearted words back, and remaining invisible to others—whose mission is to provoke moral awakening; it carries a torch that spreads bright, harmless mirth and leaves blessings as it passes [Data: Entities (227)].\\n\\nBeyond city scenes, the Spirit ranges widely—standing in almshouse, hospital, and gaol, traveling to foreign lands, and acknowledging its brief life upon the globe—underscoring both the breadth and urgency of its ministry [Data: Relationships (979, 980, 981, 987, 986)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"The Cratchit household reveals intimate, instructive domestic scenes and a specific warning about Tiny Tim.\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Scrooge accompanies the Spirit into Bob Cratchit’s home, where the family’s Christmas day activities are observed;

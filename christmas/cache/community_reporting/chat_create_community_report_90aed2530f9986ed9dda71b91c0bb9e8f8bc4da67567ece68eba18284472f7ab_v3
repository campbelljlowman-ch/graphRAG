SCROOGE is led to observe the Cratchit household, a debtor family’s relief at a creditor’s death, and two wretched children concealed beneath the Spirit’s robe, while the Spirit simultaneously ranges across institutions and foreign lands leaving blessings and emphasizing the brief, time-bound nature of its mission.
